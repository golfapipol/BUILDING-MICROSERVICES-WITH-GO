The reason we are not just using a simple string is that context often flows across packages and if we just used string then we could end up with a key clash where one package within your control is writing a name key and another package which is outside of your control is also using the context and writing a key called name, in this istance the second package would inadvertently overwrite your context value. By declaring a package level type validationContextKey and using this we can ensure that we avoid these collisions
